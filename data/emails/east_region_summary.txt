Subject: Tough Quarter for East Region Office Supplies

Team, we saw a significant dip in sales for our Office Supplies category this quarter, down 15% from last quarter. Furniture sales remain steady, but profits are thin. Technology sales are a bright spot, up 8%, especially for printers and accessories. We need to find a way to boost our high-profit items.
