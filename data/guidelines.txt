Company Strategic Directives:

1. Core Principle: Prioritize Sales Growth and Market Share Expansion. All strategic recommendations must demonstrate a clear path to increasing sales volume.
2. Growth Areas: The Technology sector is our primary focus for growth and investment. Initiatives related to this sector should be fast-tracked.
3. Brand Value: Aggressive discounting is discouraged as it can devalue the brand. Focus on volume and strategic promotions rather than deep cuts.
4. Product Mix: Avoid over-reliance on any single category. We must diversify our offerings and push sales in high-potential categories.
5. Customer Acquisition: Initiatives that attract new customers and expand our market reach are highly encouraged.
